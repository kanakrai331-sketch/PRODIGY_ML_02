"Task 02 - Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering | Prodigy Infotech ML internship" 

# 👤 **About Me**

I am Kanak Rai, a Machine Learning Intern at Prodigy Infotech.
I am passionate about data science and machine learning, with a strong interest in building real-world data-driven solutions. This project reflects my understanding of unsupervised learning and customer analytics.

# 📊 **Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to build a K-Means clustering model to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase behavior.
Customer segmentation helps businesses:
Understand customer patterns
Identify high-value customers
Design targeted marketing strategies
This project uses unsupervised learning to group customers into meaningful clusters without predefined labels.

# 🗂️ **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is Customer Segmentation Dataset sourced from Kaggle.

Key Features Used-

* Age
* Annual Income
* Spending Score
These features help in understanding customer purchasing behavior and spending patterns.

# 🤖 **Machine Learning Model**

Algorithm Used: K-Means Clustering
Type: Unsupervised Learning
Approach:
* Data preprocessing
* Feature selection
* Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters
* Customer clustering using K-Means
Visualization of clusters

# 📈 **Insights**
* Customers are grouped into distinct segments based on income and spending behavior.
* High-income high-spending customers can be targeted for premium offers.
* Low-spending customers can be engaged using promotional strategies.
* K-Means clustering helps businesses make data-driven marketing decisions.
